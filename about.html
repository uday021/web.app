                <strong>Abstract:</strong> <br>
                Skin diseases affect a significant portion of the population, causing discomfort, cosmetic concerns, and in some cases, serious health risks. Traditional diagnosis often relies on visual examination by dermatologists, which can be time-consuming and prone to subjectivity. This project explores the application of transfer learning techniques to develop an automated skin disease identification system. Leveraging pre-trained deep learning models on large image datasets, we aim to create a web-based solution that allows users to upload skin images and receive predictions of potential skin diseases. The goal is to enhance accessibility to preliminary skin assessments and provide individuals with initial guidance on further seeking appropriate medical help.

                <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> <br>
                Timely and accurate diagnosis of skin diseases can be challenging due to limited access to dermatologists, particularly in remote or underserved areas. <br>
                Visual identification of skin conditions can be subjective, with variations in diagnostic accuracy between healthcare providers. <br>
                Misdiagnosis or delays in diagnosis can negatively impact timely treatment and exacerbate skin conditions.

              <h1>Literature Survey</h1>

<h2>1. Brain Tumor Detection Using Transfer Learning in Deep Learning Summary:</h2>
<p>Alla, S. S. M., and K. Athota focus on automatic and reliable segmentation methods for early brain tumor diagnosis. Deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to extract features and classify brain tumors based on MRI images. Transfer learning was applied to three types of CNNs (Inception-V3, VGG-16, and VGG-19) to achieve reasonable accuracy. The results showed that applying transfer learning to a CNN resulted in high accuracy in less time and with a smaller dataset. This work introduces a novel technique for analyzing data with few annotations by transferring information from the source domain to the target domain.</p>

<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Features extraction made easy</li>

</ul>

<h3>Drawbacks:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No proper dataset is used, trained on small dataset.</li>
  <li>This may lead to overfitting the model to use dataset</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>During our research, we found that many of the projects are still using traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques. They are facing problems in collecting or gathering data to train the model. So we decided to use the transfer learning approach,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Utilize transfer learning with pre-trained models to leverage knowledge from large datasets, potentially improving the model's performance with limited dermatological data.</li>
  <li>Augment the training dataset to include a diverse range of skin tones, conditions, and backgrounds to enhance the model's generalization.</li>
  <li>Enhance the user interface to facilitate seamless image upload, display of diagnosis results, and user feedback, creating a user-friendly experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>The skin disease detection has become one of the major issues in the medical field and can be solved if it is diagnosed in its early stage. The literature survey mentioned above shows different techniques used in detection of skin diseases across the world. We can see that how application of machine learning helps in lessening the work of dermatologists. Users can make use of android app without having extra equipment.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Transfer Learning with VGG16</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Reduced Training Time:</strong> By leveraging pre-trained weights, the model requires less training data and time to achieve good performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Generalizability:</strong> Transfer learning helps the model learn robust features that are generally applicable to image recognition tasks, including skin disease identification.</li>
    <li><strong>Overfitting Prevention:</strong> Starting with pre-trained weights helps prevent the model from overfitting to a limited dataset of skin disease images.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages of Transfer Learning with VGG16</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Fine-Tuning Complexity:</strong> While VGG16 is a good starting point, fine-tuning all layers might not be optimal. Determining which layers to fine-tune requires experimentation.</li>
    <li><strong>Potential Bias:</strong> The pre-trained VGG16 model might have biases inherited from the ImageNet dataset, which may not be ideal for skin disease classification. Techniques like data augmentation can help mitigate this.</li>
    <li><strong>Computational Cost:</strong> VGG16 is a large architecture, requiring more computational resources for training and inference compared to some lighter models.</li>
